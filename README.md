##  Overview of the project

###  Project: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) on "Tips" Dataset
The objective of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is to gain insights into the data, uncover underlying patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through summary statistics and graphical representations.

###  Key Activities
  -Data Collection and Loading: Import libraries (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib) and Load the dataset.
  -Data Inspection: Display the first few rows with head(). Get dataset summary using info(). Generate basic statistics with describe().
  -Data Cleaning: Identify and handle missing values using isnull().sum(). Check for duplicates. Identify and handle outliers.
  -Data Transformation: Perform feature engineering. Normalize or scale numerical features. 
  -Documentation and Reporting: Summarize key findings and data quality issues. Include relevant plots and charts in the report. Provide recommendations for further analysis or next steps.

###  Technologies and Libraries Used
  -Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis.
  -Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis. Loading, displaying, and summarizing the dataset. Checking for missing values.
  -NumPy: Numerical operations on arrays and matrices. Handling numerical data and performing calculations.
  -Seaborn: Statistical data visualization. Loading built-in datasets. Creating scatter plots and heatmaps.
  -Matplotlib: Creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. Displaying histograms and enhancing plots generated by Seaborn.
